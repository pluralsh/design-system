## ✨ Features

Plural will deploy open source applications on Kubernetes in your cloud using common standards like Helm and Terraform.

The Plural platform provides the following:

* Dependency management between Terraform/Helm modules, with dependency-aware deployment and upgrades.
* Authenticated docker registry and chartmuseum proxy per repository.
* Secret encryption using AES-256 (so you can keep the entire workflow in git).

In addition, Plural also handles:
* Issuing the certificates.
* Configuring a DNS service to register fully-qualified domains under onplural.sh to eliminate the hassle of DNS registration for users.
* Being an OIDC provider to enable zero touch login security for all Plural applications.

We think it's pretty cool! 😎 Some other nice things:

### ☁️ Build and manage open cloud-native architectures

<br/><br/>
</p>

The plural platform ingests all deployment artifacts needed to deploy cloud-native applications and tracks their dependencies, allowing for easy installs and no-touch upgrades post-install. 

### 🤖 Day-2 Operational Toolkit

<br/>
</p>

Scale deploys with operational run-books for key cluster operations. Every dependency is automatically upgraded in the correct order, in a rolling manner. Plural provides a timestamped audit trail for all cluster applications along with searchable, downloadable logs. In addition, there are also pre-packaged dashboards for the highest importance metrics.

### 🔓 Secure by default
Plural performs regular security scans for application images, helm charts, and terraform modules and comes equipped with OpenID connect for user auth to applications deployed by Plural.

### 🥳 Open source and extensible
All Plural applications are fully customizable and able to be ejected at any time. New applications can be wrapped and packaged onto Plural easily, giving you total freedom about how, when and where to use Plural.
